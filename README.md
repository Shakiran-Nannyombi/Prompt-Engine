# Prompt-Engine Application

> **Disclaimer**
>
> This evaluation was conducted by using ChatGPT to research prompt engineering problems on Reddit. The insights gathered helped me to define the solution this application offers clearly and refined my vision.

## Overview

The Prompt Engine is a **dual-agent application** designed to solve common problems users face with prompt engineering (identified from Reddit discussions and industry practice).

**Refiner Agent:** Automatically rewrites user prompts into effective, structured versions using best frameworks.

**Coach Agent:** Teaches users why those refinements matter, building long-term skill in effective prompting.

This creates both instant utility (better prompts now) and user growth (learn prompting strategies for future tasks).

## Core Problems to Solve

This is a list of problems gathered from Reddit with how they impacted tyhe user and expected solution the application is to solve

| Problem spotted on Reddit | What users are doing wrong |
|---------|-------------|
| Prompts are bloated/verbose and worse for it. ([Reddit][1]) | "More words = more control." |
| Overloaded context (token dilution). ([Reddit][3]) | Stuffing backstory/history into every call. |
| No role framing/persona. ([Reddit][3]) | Leaving the model "default." |
| Hallucinations & weak verification. ([Anthropic][6], [Business Insider][7]) | Asking for confident answers without checks. |
| Lack of engineering rigor; cargo-culting prompts. ([Reddit][10]) | Copying "magic prompts" w/o evals. |
| Hard to scale agents; monolithic prompts. ([Reddit][4]) | One mega-prompt does planning+execution+memory. |
| Repetition from "anchor language." ([Reddit][11]) | Reusing same scaffolding words → repetitive outputs. |
| Users think "prompting is dead; just add context." ([Reddit][12]) | Ignoring instructions/format requests. |
| Evaluation difficulty/reproducibility. ([Reddit][13]) | No way to know if a change helped. |
| Confusion over when to reason step-by-step. ([Prompting Guide][14]) | Either never ask for reasoning or always force it. |

Prompt Engineering Challenges (Reddit & Community Threads)

1. Reddit – Prompt engineering is dead. It's all context ([discussion of prompt context overload, ignoring instructions, and role framing issues]).
2. Reddit – Overloaded context and token dilution in prompt design ([on why stuffing history/backstory reduces output quality]).
3. Reddit – Common prompt engineering mistakes (verbosity, anchor repetition) ([users reporting diminishing results with verbose prompts]).
4. Reddit – Cargo-culting prompts: why copying "magic prompts" fails ([discussion on lack of evaluation rigor in prompt design]).
5. Reddit – Scaling agents with modular prompts ([insights on planner vs executor separation]).
